<h1 id="toc_0">Family Services</h1>

<p>The Family Visiting Service is designed to provide families with the individual support they require.  Guided by the family’s needs we offer a listening ear, guidance, information, relevant links and contacts to enable families to realise their full potential.  </p>

<p>Through key contact visits we deliver a Sure Start programme to all babies born in the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area.  All families receive various items through a series of planned visits until the child has reached the age of two.  During this period any family, if they wish, may avail of our regular monthly support service.  These regular monthly support visits continue as long as a parent wishes until the child reaches age 4 or if the family move out of the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area.  </p>

<p>We provide information about other services and in particular services available through Coleraine Sure Start Partnership.  </p>

<p>We facilitate a number of groups (see group information) and programmes delivered on behalf of Sure Start.  Programmes such as Nurturing, Cook-it, Infant Massage and Toddler Yoga are facilitated by ourselves and other Sure Start staff.  </p>

<h1 id="toc_0">Introduction</h1>

<p>The Project was established in 1993 to address low levels of preparedness for school.
It takes a holistic approach combining community development with delivering 
people-centred, family support services.  </p>

<p>The Project runs an <a href="/harpurs/childcare">Early Years programme</a>, a <a href="/harpurs/families">home visiting service</a> and a range of personal development programmes and <a href="/harpurs/groups">activities for adults</a>.  It also encourages parents to become involved in running the Project.  The Project also shares the building with the Cuilrath Corner Nursery School which is run by the Education Service.  </p>

<p>Since 1999 the Project has become one of the main players in the delivery of Children's Services in the Coleraine Area and in 2003 it became the lead body of the Coleraine Sure Start Partnership.  </p>

<p>The Project is managed by a Board representing a range of stakeholders and is a company limited by guarantee.  </p>
