#One to one
We currently connect with families who have children under 4 years of age through regular visits to the home.  We believe it is important that parents should be able to access this type of support in their own home and our Family Support Workers spend time getting to know the parent through listening, befriending, guiding and signposting to services relevant to the family.

Through key contact visits we deliver a [Sure Start](http://www.colerainesurestart.org.uk) programme to all babies born in the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area. All families receive various items through a series of planned visits until the child has reached the age of four. During this period any family, if they wish, may avail of our regular monthly support service. These regular monthly support visits continue as long as a parent wishes until the child reaches age 4 or if the family move out of the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area.

For further information on our Family Support Service, contact Gretta on 028 70321620.
