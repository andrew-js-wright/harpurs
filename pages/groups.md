#Group Support

##Tuesday Group##

This group is for parents of children with additional needs.  It aims to provide a listening ear and help direct parents or carers to sources of relevant information as well as being a friendly, caring and supportive environment.  

The Tuesday Group at Harpurs Hill Children and Family Centre runs every Tuesday, during term time from 10.00am to 11.30am.  

Come along and join other parents at our additional needs group.  Have a cup of tea, a chat and a laugh with staff and parents in a relaxed setting.  

No matter who we are, there are times when it’s good to talk!  

For more information contact Margaret or Pauline on 028 703 21620.  



##Women’s Group##

The Women’s Group aims to support women as parents to discuss relevant issues in a safe environment.  

The Women’s Group at Harpurs Hill Community Centre runs every Wednesday, during term time from 10.00am – 12.00.  

Got some time on your hands?  Come along and join us... meet other mums, have a chat over a cuppa, try new activities and workshops.  What about my kids?  We offer a creche service for children aged 0 – 4 years.

**NB:** Creche places are limited and in high demand, therefore contact Karen or Shirley to ensure a place is available.
