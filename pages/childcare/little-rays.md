#Little Rays â€“ Sure Start Two to Three Year Old Development Programme

The [Sure Start](http://www.colerainesurestart.org.uk) programme for two to three year olds is an exciting programme where the emphasis is on play and creativity.  We offer a variety of opportunities not only to young children but also to their parents and carers by actively involving them in the programme, thus helping to create strong relationships within our Centre.

Criteria for this programme specifically targeted at two year olds living in the [Coleraine Sure Start](http://www.colerainesurestart.org.uk) catchment area.
