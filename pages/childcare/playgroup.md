#Sunshine Playgroup
By the time the children start Sunshine Playgroup, we recognise that they have already had a variety of experiences and have developed in a number of ways.  We will endeavour to build upon the learning that has taken place in the home and their immediate environment as well as previous play experiences.  Therefore the staff team will provide children with a rich variety of challenging play activities and other experiences in a stimulating environment.  The focus will be to allow children to learn at their own pace, gain a positive image of themselves as learners, be able to cope with uncertainty and to learn through trial and error.  The staff team use the ‘Preschool Curricular Guidance’ document as laid down by the Department of Education to influence their planning.
