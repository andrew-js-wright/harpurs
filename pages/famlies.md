#Family Services

The Family Visiting Service is designed to provide families with the individual support they require.  Guided by the familyâ€™s needs we offer a listening ear, guidance, information, relevant links and contacts to enable families to realise their full potential.  

Through key contact visits we deliver a Sure Start programme to all babies born in the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area.  All families receive various items through a series of planned visits until the child has reached the age of two.  During this period any family, if they wish, may avail of our regular monthly support service.  These regular monthly support visits continue as long as a parent wishes until the child reaches age 4 or if the family move out of the Coleraine Sure Start catchment area.  

We provide information about other services and in particular services available through Coleraine Sure Start Partnership.  

We facilitate a number of groups (see group information) and programmes delivered on behalf of Sure Start.  Programmes such as Nurturing, Cook-it, Infant Massage and Toddler Yoga are facilitated by ourselves and other Sure Start staff.
