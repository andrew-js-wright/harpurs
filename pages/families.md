#Family Services

The Family Support Team within Harpurs Hill Children and Family Centre recognise 
that being a parent is one of the hardest, but also one of the most rewarding, roles 
a person will ever undertake.  We understand that for some families friendly support 
and advice can make all the difference. We support parents and families on a 
[one-to-one]({{urls.base_url}}one-to-ones) basis in their own homes, or in 
[groups]({{urls.base_url}}groups) or through [programmes]({{urls.base_url}}programmes) 
and can provide access to more specialist help and support should they or their children need it.
  We currently deliver our Family Support Service on behalf of the 
  [Coleraine Sure Start Partnership](http://www.colerainesurestart.org.uk).
