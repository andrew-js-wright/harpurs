#Family Services

The Family Support Team within Harpurs Hill Children and Family Centre recognise  that being a parent is one of the hardest roles a person will ever undertake.  We understand that for some families friendly support and advice can make all the difference. We support parents and families on a [one-to-one](/families/one-to-ones) basis in their own homes, or in [groups](/groups) or through [programmes](/families/programmes) and can provide access to more specialist help and support should they or their children need it.  We currently deliver our Family Support Service on behalf of the [Coleraine Sure Start Partnership](http://www.colerainesurestart.org.uk).
